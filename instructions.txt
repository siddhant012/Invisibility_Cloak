1.Specify the rerquired values in the main function of the invisibility_cloak.py file.
2.The process works by first recording some boundary values for the color to be identified.This is done by tweaking the min and max hsv sliders provided.The 
area within the selected range will be blackened.Tweak the sliders till the object to be recognized is completely blackened.Then press esc to save and exit.
3.Then the background image will be recorded.Webcam will open after a timer and record the background image.Move out of the frame at that time.Webcam closes
automatically and saves the background file.
4.Steps 2 and 3 need to be done only once.After the required files have been recorded successfully , the corresponding code lines can be commented.
5.If background image has changed then new background has to be recorded again.
6.After the background and color boundaries have been recorded successfully , run the file after commenting the above said lines.The color within the specified 
color range will be replaced by the background image.
